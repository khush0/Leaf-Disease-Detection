Leaf Disease detection using image processing
About 70% of the India economy depends on agriculture. Due to environmental changes such as rainfall, temperature, the crop yield gets affected severely. Phaseolus vulgaris L. is an important food legume crops and provide essential diet for millions of people across the world. It is affected by various diseases out of which Anthracnose are of major importance. Anthracnose disease is caused by fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum.

Image processing is a technique which is most spoken for very high accuracy and least time consumption are major advantages offered. The applications of K-means clustering have been formulated for clustering and KNN (K Nearest neighbor) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) is used for classification of diseases that effect on plant leaves. Recognizing the disease accurately and efficiently is mainly the purpose of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is a valuable approach, which can significantly support an accurate detection of leaf diseases in a little computational effort.
